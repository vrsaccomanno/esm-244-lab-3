##A. Bootstrapping penguin flipper lengths

###1. Get penguin data:

- Data: Penguin sizes collected November 2007, Palmer Station Antarctica LTER). 

- Citation: Gorman K. 2017. Structural size measurements and isotopic signatures of foraging among adult male and female Ad√©lie penguins (Pygoscelis adeliae) nesting along the Palmer Archipelago near Palmer Station, 2007-2009. Environmental Data Initiative. http://dx.doi.org/10.6073/pasta/abc50eed9138b75f54eaada0841b9b86. Dataset accessed 1/29/2018.

```{r}

# Read in data
penguins <- read_csv("penguins.csv")
```

###2. Some wrangling:

```{r}
# Only male penguins
male_p <- penguins %>% 
  filter(sex == "MALE")

# Exploratory graph
ggplot(male_p, aes(x = flipper_length)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 12) +
  theme_light()

# Pull flipper lengths as a vector
flippers <- male_p %>% 
  pull(flipper_length)
```

###3. Create a function, do some bootstrapping:

```{r}
# Create a function to calculate the mean of varying vectors (x) of index (i)
mean_fun <- function (x,i) {mean(x[i])}

# First try - 10 bootstrap samples (silly to do in practice, good for demonstration)
# 10 bootstrap samples: 
boot_10 <- boot(flippers, mean_fun, R = 10)

# Reporting outcomes of bootstrapping: 
boot_10$t # to report means of all 10 bootstrap samples
boot_10$t0 # to report the mean of the original sample
boot_10

# But I'm not actually entirely sure why this works...
ggplot() +
  aes(boot_10$t) + 
  geom_histogram()


# 100 bootstrap samples: 
boot_100 <- boot(flippers, mean_fun, R = 100)

ggplot() +
  aes(boot_100$t) + 
  geom_histogram()

# 1000 bootstrap samples: 
boot_1000 <- boot(flippers, mean_fun, R = 1000)

ggplot() +
  aes(boot_1000$t) + 
  geom_histogram()

# 10000 bootstrap samples: 
boot_10000 <- boot(flippers, mean_fun, R = 10000)

ggplot() +
  aes(boot_10000$t) + 
  geom_histogram()

# 100000 bootstrap samples:
boot_100000 <- boot(flippers, mean_fun, R = 100000)

ggplot() +
  aes(boot_100000$t) +
  geom_histogram()

boot_100000$t0 # to report the mean of the original sample
boot_100000 # to report bias, SE

```

###4. Find a bootstrapped confidence interval:

```{r}

boot.ci(boot_100000, conf = 0.95) # Notice here: pretty similar across CI methods

# For comparison, what does the CI look like for the original sample based on the t-distribution? 

t.test(flippers)

```

What else? We could also bootstrap the median, for example - which we couldn't get a measure of uncertainty for if we only had our single sample. You could write that function...

##B. Assessing missingness, and an imputation example (w/ airquality dataset)

Using the naniar package by Nick Tierney (there are others...this one seems straightforward and I wanted to try it out) 

**Note**: These examples are taken/updated directly from Nick Tierney's package documentation + vignettes. More here: <https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/naniar/vignettes/getting-started-w-naniar.html>

```{r}

# Visualize missings:
vis_miss(airquality) 

# Visualize numberes of missings by variable:

gg_miss_var(airquality, facet = Month) # Show without facet arg first

# Figure out how to best describe this plot before lab...
ggplot(airquality,
       aes(x = Ozone,
           y = Solar.R)) +
 geom_miss_point()

# See the difference from just:
ggplot(airquality,
       aes(x = Ozone,
           y = Solar.R)) +
  geom_point()

# Can also use facets to see missings by group:
ggplot(airquality,
       aes(x = Solar.R, 
           y = Temp)) +
  geom_miss_point() + 
  scale_color_manual(values = c("orange","purple")) +
  facet_wrap(~Month) +
  theme_minimal()
```

Make a shadow matrix of NA values (a tibble just showing which values are NA vs !NA): 

```{r}

# Make a shadow matrix, then bind to original df
na_shadow <- bind_shadow(airquality)

```


Imputation by linear regression (using simputation pkg), and visualize: 

```{r}

airquality %>%
  impute_lm(Ozone ~ Temp + Wind) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Temp,
             y = Ozone)) + 
  geom_point()

# But wouldn't it be nice to show which ones are actually imputed? YES. Luckily we made a shadow matrix...

na_shadow %>%
  impute_lm(Ozone ~ Temp + Wind) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Temp,
             y = Ozone,
             colour = Ozone_NA)) + 
  geom_point()

# Now we can see where the imputed values exist, wrt the actual complete cases.  

```
